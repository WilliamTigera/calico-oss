# Dex

This sub repo replaces tigera/dex and tigera/dexidp-docker. Instead, it uses the upstream code, applies a patch file on it, 
so that we can keep supporting FIPS builds and then uses our own base image to reduce the CVE footprint.

The cmd folder is generated by the makefile.

The web folder contains our own branding and is copied from tigera/dex.

When updating upstream Dex, there are three steps involved:
- Update go.mod
- Update UPSTREAM_DEX_VERSION in Makefile
- Verify that the patch can still be applied or create a new patch file.
