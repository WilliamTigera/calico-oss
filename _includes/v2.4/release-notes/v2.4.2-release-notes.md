## Enhancements

- {{site.prodname}} now installs a Tigera branded Kibana when setting up Kibana using the `elasticsearch-operator`.
- The Anomaly Detection jobs have been updated to only alert on anomalously high levels.
- The `elastic-tsee-installer` now deletes and re-installs Kibana dashboards and Anomaly Detection jobs on startup.
- The `cnx-manager` pod does not require privileged security context.

## Bug Fixes

- Compliance reports now include appropriate namespaced resources when the corresponding Kubernetes Namespace is deleted.
- Fix locking of host-local IPAM directory on upgrade.
- Fixed slow memory leak that was noticed with lots of workload churn.

## Upgrade notes

#### Upgrading from {{site.prodname}} v2.2 or earlier

{{site.prodname}} v2.3 introduced a change to how RBAC is applied to network policy resources
that requires explicit actions when upgrading from a previous {{site.prodname}} release.
The upgrade instructions can be found [here](../maintenance/kubernetes-upgrade-tsee).

> **Important**: Failure to follow the upgrade procedure will result in non cluster-admin users
> being unable to perform any operations on NetworkPolicy and GlobalNetworkPolicy resources.

  Istio is supported on OpenShift.
