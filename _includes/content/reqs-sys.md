## Node requirements

- x86-64 processor with at least 2 cores, 8.0GB RAM and 20 GB free disk space

- Linux kernel 3.10 or later with [required dependencies](#kernel-dependencies).
  The following distributions have the required kernel, its dependencies, and are
  known to work well with {{site.prodname}} and {{include.orch}}.{% if include.orch == "Kubernetes" or include.orch == "host protection" %}
  - CentOS 7
  - Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04
  - RHEL 7
  - Debian 9
  {% endif %}{% if include.orch == "OpenShift" %}
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS
  {% endif %}{% if include.orch == "OpenStack" %}
  - Ubuntu 18.04
  - CentOS 8
  {% endif %}

- {{site.prodname}} must be able to manage `cali*` interfaces on the host. When IPIP is
  enabled (the default), {{site.prodname}} also needs to be able to manage `tunl*` interfaces.
  When VXLAN is enabled, {{site.prodname}} also needs to be able to manage the `vxlan.calico` interface.

  > **Note**: Many Linux distributions, such as most of the above, include NetworkManager.
  > By default, NetworkManager does not allow {{site.prodname}} to manage interfaces.
  > If your nodes have NetworkManager, complete the steps in
  > [Preventing NetworkManager from controlling {{site.prodname}} interfaces]({{ site.baseurl }}/maintenance/troubleshoot/troubleshooting#configure-networkmanager)
  > before installing {{site.prodname}}.

- In order to properly run Elasticsearch, nodes must be configured according to the
  [Elasticsearch system configuration documentation.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/system-config.html){:target="_blank"}

- The Typha autoscaler requires a minimum number of Linux worker nodes based on total number of schedulable nodes.

  | Total schedulable nodes | Required Linux nodes for Typha replicas |
  |-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
  | 1                       | 1
  | 2                       | 2
  | 3                       | 3
  | up to 250               | 4
  | up to 500               | 5
  | up to 1000              | 6
  | up to 1500              | 7
  | up to 2000              | 8
  | 2000 or more            | 10

## Key/value store

{{site.prodname}} {{page.version}} requires a key/value store accessible by all
{{site.prodname}} components.
{%- if include.orch == "OpenShift" %}
With OpenShift, the Kubernetes API datastore is used for the key/value store.{% endif -%}
{%- if include.orch == "Kubernetes" %}
On Kubernetes, you can configure {{site.prodname}} to access an etcdv3 cluster directly or to
use the Kubernetes API datastore.{% endif -%}
{%- if include.orch == "OpenStack" %}
For production you will likely want multiple
nodes for greater performance and reliability.  If you don't already have an
etcdv3 cluster to connect to, please refer to {% include open-new-window.html text='the upstream etcd
docs' url='https://coreos.com/etcd/' %} for detailed advice and setup.{% endif %}{% if include.orch == "host protection" %}{% endif %}

## Network requirements

Ensure that your hosts and firewalls allow the necessary traffic based on your configuration.

## Privileges

Ensure that {{site.prodname}} has the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` privilege.

The simplest way to provide the necessary privilege is to run {{site.prodname}} as root or in a privileged container.

{%- if include.orch == "Kubernetes" %}
When installed as a Kubernetes daemon set, {{site.prodname}} meets this requirement by running as a
privileged container. This requires that the kubelet be allowed to run privileged
containers. There are two ways this can be achieved.

- Specify `--allow-privileged` on the kubelet (deprecated).
- Use a {% include open-new-window.html text='pod security policy' url='https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/' %}.
