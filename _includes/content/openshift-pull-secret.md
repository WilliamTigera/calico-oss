1. Download the pull secret manifest template into the manifests directory.

   ```bash
   curl {{ "/manifests/ocp/02-pull-secret.yaml" | absolute_url }} -o manifests/02-pull-secret.yaml
   ```

1. Update the contents of the secret with the image pull secret provided to you by Tigera.

   For example, if the secret is located at `~/.docker/config.json`, run the following commands.

   ```bash
   SECRET=$(cat ~/.docker/config.json | tr -d '\n\r\t ' | base64 -w 0)
   sed -i "s/SECRET/${SECRET}/" manifests/02-pull-secret.yaml
   ```
