#### Bug Fixes

 - Fix bug in parsing of empty namespace selectors [libcalico-go #857](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/857) (@caseydavenport)

 - Add support for configuring container IP forwarding via the CNI configuration file. [cni-plugin #509](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/509) (@caseydavenport)

#### Limitations

- **Offers only Kubernetes, OpenShift, OpenStack, and host endpoint integrations**: the
Mesos, DC/OS, and libnetwork orchestrators have not been tested. The latest supported release
for these orchestrators is v2.6. We plan to resume support for these orchestrators in a future release.

- **GoBGP not supported**: Setting the `CALICO_NETWORKING_BACKEND` environment
variable to `gobgp` is not supported. See [Configuring {{site.nodecontainer}}](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/reference/node/configuration)
for more information. We plan to resume support for GoBGP in a future release.

- **Route reflectors cannot be clustered**: We plan to resume support for
this in a future release.
