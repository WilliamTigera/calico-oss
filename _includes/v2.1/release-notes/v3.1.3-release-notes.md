#### Bug Fixes

- Fix a bug in the CNI plugin where IP allocations were not properly updated on container restart [cni-plugin #538](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/538) (@caseydavenport)
- Fix etcd cert file existence check in calico/cni [cni-plugin #530](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/530) (@bjhaid)
- When run as a pod, the CNI plugin will be configured with the Kubernetes certificate authority for TLS verification. [cni-plugin #530](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/530) (@tmjd)
- For updated Kubernetes clusters that allow it, you may include both a pod and namespace selector on a NetworkPolicyPeer. [libcalico-go #872](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/872) (@spikecurtis)
- Fix a bug where IPAM would not use existing IP blocks. [libcalico-go #870](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/870) (@gunjan5)

#### Limitations

- **Offers only Kubernetes, OpenShift, OpenStack, and host endpoint integrations**: the
Mesos, DC/OS, and libnetwork orchestrators have not been tested. The latest supported release
for these orchestrators is v2.6. We plan to resume support for these orchestrators in a future release.

- **GoBGP not supported**: Setting the `CALICO_NETWORKING_BACKEND` environment
variable to `gobgp` is not supported. See [Configuring {{site.nodecontainer}}](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/reference/node/configuration)
for more information. We plan to resume support for GoBGP in a future release.

- **Route reflectors cannot be clustered**: We plan to resume support for
this in a future release.
