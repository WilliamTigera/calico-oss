### New Suspicious IPs and Domains Feed Formats

{{site.prodname}} v2.7 introduces a non-backwards compatible change to
the format of the `GlobalThreatFeed` object. The `spec.format` field
is changed from a `string` to a `map` to enable the parameters needed
by the JSON and CSV formats.

Before upgrading to {{site.prodname}} v2.7, you **must** modify all of
your `GlobalThreatFeed` objects that have set the `spec.format` field
by removing that field from the manifest and reapplying, or manually
delete them from the data store using `etcdctl`. If you do not make this
change, feeds will no longer function. For help configuring the new
formats, see Suspicious [IPs](../security/threat-detection-and-prevention/suspicious-IPs)
and [Domains](../security/threat-detection-and-prevention/suspicious-domains).

> **Important**: In {{site.prodname}} v2.6 and earlier, the
`spec.format` field was optional and could contain `NewlineDelimited`.
If you downgrade to {{site.prodname}} v2.6 or earlier, you must first
delete all `GlobalThreatFeeds` that include a `format` field, or
manually delete them from the data store using `etcdctl`.
