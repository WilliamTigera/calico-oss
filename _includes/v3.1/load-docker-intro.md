## Setting up access to the private {{site.tseeprodname}} images

### About setting up access to the private {{site.tseeprodname}} images

{{site.tseeprodname}} includes several private images. You can access these
in either of the following ways.

- [Pull the images from Tigera's private registry](#pulling-the-images-from-tigeras-private-registry):
  This method is easier and suitable for clusters with Internet access.

- [Pull the images from another private registry](#pulling-the-images-from-another-private-registry) 
  (Advanced) This method allows you to perform offline installs for clusters
  without Internet access.
