                            (e.g. IPv6 in IPv4 only cluster) is an error condition

                            Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is
                            not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints
                            object. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated
                            and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints
                            rather than a stable IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP
                            and allocates a port on every node which routes to the

                            cloud) which routes to the clusterIP. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types'

                                is the only supported data source. If the provisioner
                                can support VolumeSnapshot data source, it will create
                                a new volume and data will be restored to the volume
                                at the same time. If the provisioner does not support
                                VolumeSnapshot data source, volume will not be created
                                and the failure will be reported as an event. In the

                            IPv6).  If a specific IP family is requested, the clusterIP
                            field will be allocated from that family, if it is available
                            in the cluster.  If no IP family is requested, the cluster's
                            primary IP family will be used. Other IP fields (loadBalancerIP,
                            loadBalancerSourceRanges, externalIPs) and controllers
                            which allocate external load-balancers should use the

                            (e.g. IPv6 in IPv4 only cluster) is an error condition
                            and will fail during clusterIP assignment.

                GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

                If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).
