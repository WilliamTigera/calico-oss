                description: "The selector is an expression used to pick out the endpoints
                  that the policy should be applied to.  The selector will only match
                  endpoints in the same namespace as the PacketCapture resource. \n
                  Selector expressions follow this syntax: \n \tlabel == \"string_literal\"
                  \ ->  comparison, e.g. my_label == \"foo bar\" \tlabel != \"string_literal\"
                  \  ->  not equal; also matches if label is not present \tlabel in
                  { \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", ... }  ->  true if the value of label X is
                  one of \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" \tlabel not in { \"a\", \"b\", \"c\",
                  ... }  ->  true if the value of label X is not one of \"a\", \"b\",
                  \"c\" \thas(label_name)  -> True if that label is present \t! expr
                  -> negation of expr \texpr && expr  -> Short-circuit and \texpr
                  || expr  -> Short-circuit or \t( expr ) -> parens for grouping \tall()
                  or the empty selector -> matches all endpoints. \n Label names are
                  allowed to contain alphanumerics, -, _ and /. String literals are
                  more permissive but they do not support escape characters. \n Examples
                  (with made-up labels): \n \ttype == \"webserver\" && deployment
                  == \"prod\" \ttype in {\"frontend\", \"backend\"} \tdeployment !=
                  \"dev\" \t! has(label_name)"
