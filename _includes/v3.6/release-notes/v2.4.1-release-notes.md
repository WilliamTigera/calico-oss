## Bug Fixes

- Fix flow visualization not coloring denied flows appropriately in {{site.tseeprodname}} Manager.

## Upgrade notes

#### Upgrading from {{site.tseeprodname}} v2.2 or earlier

{{site.tseeprodname}} v2.3 introduced a change to how RBAC is applied to network policy resources
that requires explicit actions when upgrading from a previous {{site.tseeprodname}} release.
The upgrade instructions can be found [here](../maintenance/kubernetes-upgrade-tsee).

> **Important**: Failure to follow the upgrade procedure will result in non cluster-admin users
> being unable to perform any operations on NetworkPolicy and GlobalNetworkPolicy resources.
