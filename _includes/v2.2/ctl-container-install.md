## Installing {{include.cli}} as a container on a single host

1. Ensure that you have the [`config.json` file with the private Tigera registry credentials](/{{page.version}}/getting-started/#obtain-the-private-registry-credentials).

1. From a terminal prompt, use the following command to either create or open the `~/.docker/config.json` file.

   ```bash
   vi ~/.docker/config.json
   ```

1. Depending on the existing contents of the file, edit it in one of the following ways.

   - **New file**: Paste in the entire contents of the `config.json` file from Tigera.

   - **Existing file without quay.io object**: Add the following lines from the `config.json` inside the `"auth"` object.

     ```json
     "quay.io": {
       "auth": "<ROBOT-TOKEN-VALUE>",
       "email": ""
     }
     ```

   - **Existing file with quay.io object**: Add the following lines from the `config.json` inside the `"quay.io"` object.

     ```json
     "auth": "<ROBOT-TOKEN-VALUE>",
     "email": ""
     ```

1. Save and close the file.

1. Use the following commands to pull the `{{include.cli}}` image from the Tigera
   registry.

   ```bash
   docker pull {{site.imageNames[include.cli]}}:{{site.data.versions[page.version].first.components[include.cli].version}}
   ```

1. Confirm that the image has loaded by typing `docker images`.

   ```bash
   REPOSITORY                TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
   {{site.imageNames[include.cli]}}    {{site.data.versions[page.version].first.components[include.cli].version}}            e07d59b0eb8a   2 minutes ago   42MB
   ```

**Next step**:

## Installing {{include.cli}} as a Kubernetes pod

The steps to install `{{include.cli}}` as a container on each node vary according to where you
want to pull the image from. Refer to the section that corresponds to your preferred
private repository.

- [Pulling the image from Tigera's private registry](#pulling-the-image-from-tigeras-private-registry)
- [Pulling the image from another private registry](#pulling-the-image-from-another-private-registry)

### Pulling the image from Tigera's private registry

{% include {{page.version}}/load-docker-our-reg.md yaml=include.cli %}

**Next step**:
[Executing a {{include.cli}} command in the pod](#executing-a-{{include.cli}}-command-in-the-pod).

### Pulling the image from another private registry

{% include {{page.version}}/load-docker.md yaml=include.cli %}

**Next step**:
