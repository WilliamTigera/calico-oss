### Bug fixes

- Fix failure to log in with OIDC.
- Allow custom kube-dns/coredns suffixes instead of failing DNS resolution.
- Felix waits for the xtables lock when forced to by iptables.
- Felix works around conntrack set up race causing occasional DNS timeouts when NATing.
- Fix Typha sometimes not handling Kubernetes API server restarts gracefully.
- Fix DNS resolution from within cnx-node image caused by missing nsswitch.conf.

### Upgrade notes

- The liveness check for the HAProxy in front of {{site.tseeprodname}} Manager has changed.  When upgrading, be sure to apply
  the new cnx.yaml rather than just updating the version numbers, or copy the changes to your cnx.yaml.
