### Security fixes

- Stops certain components from logging service account tokens. Users able to
  access the logs could use the service account tokens to gain unauthorized access
  to the cluster or escalate their privileges.

  - The CNI plugin no longer include Kubernetes service account tokens in logs when
    the logging level is set to `debug`. Note that `debug` is not the default logging
    level.

  - The CNI plugin and CNX API server no longer include Kubernetes service account
    tokens in logs when the logging level is set to `info` and the `K8S_AUTH_TOKEN`
    field is set. Note that `K8S_AUTH_TOKEN` is not set by standard {{site.tseeprodname}}
    manifests and `info` is the default logging level.

  If any tokens may have been leaked by the above, after upgrading to this release
  also delete the leaked secrets.  Service account secrets will be regenerated by
  the token controller.

  For further details please see the [security advisory](https://www.projectcalico.org/security-bulletins/#TTA-2018-001)
  or contact Tigera support.

- Fix possible denial of service attack on cnx-queryserver.
  Sending certain malformed messages to cnx-queryserver can cause it to crash,
  preventing other users from being able to see certain traffic and policy statistics
  in {{site.tseeprodname}} Manager. No action is needed beyond upgrading to the newest image.

- Fixes CVEs in Alpine Linux base images of {{site.tseeprodname}} Manager and fluentd.
