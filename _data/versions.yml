v2.0:
- title: v2.0.0-cnx-beta2
  note: |
    03 December 2017

    This is a pre-release of v2.0.0. This release is intended for testing purposes only and is NOT to be used on production systems.

    #### What's new

    - **Tiered policy**: policies can be grouped into tiers to allow structured security policy.

    - **CNX Manager**: a new web interface allows you to edit and manage tiers and policies.

    - **CNX API server**: a RESTful API to edit and manage tiers and policies that can impose fine-grained control over what tiers users can manipulate policies in.

    - **Prometheus operator update**: this release includes a newer Prometheus operator.

    - **Built on Calico v3.0.0-beta1**: including features and limitations of that release other than as specified here.

    #### Limitations

    - **No upgrades**: existing customers should start a fresh cluster for testing this release.  There is no migration support, and it is not possible to upgrade to or from this release.  We plan to add migration and upgrade support in the GA release from and to other GA releases, but never this beta.

    - **Integrates only with Kubernetes and host endpoints**: the OpenShift, OpenStack, Mesos, DC/OS, rkt, and Docker orchestrators have not been tested and are not supported. (CNX still supports Docker and rkt containers.) We plan to resume support for the OpenShift, OpenStack, Mesos, DC/OS, and Docker orchestrators in a future release.

    - **BGP route reflector not supported**: large deployments that require the [BGP route reflector](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.0/usage/routereflector/bird-rr-config) are not supported. We plan to resume support for the BGP route reflector in a future release.

    - **GoBGP not supported**: setting the `CALICO_NETWORKING_BACKEND` environment variable to `gobgp` is not supported. See [Configuring calico/node](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.0/reference/node/configuration) for more information. We plan to resume support for GoBPG in a future release.

    - **Typha not supported**: the Typha datastore proxy is not supported in this release.
