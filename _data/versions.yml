- title: v2.0.2
  note: |
    6 March 2018
    This release fixes a manifest problem with Kubernetes 1.8.8 and 1.9.3, as well
    as incorporating some other minor fixes.  It does not add any new features.
    - Ignore hidden files when checking for etcd certificates to copy over when installing CNI. [cni-plugin #473](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/473) (@tmjd)
    - Improved error messages when failing to initialize a connection to etcd [libcalico-go #794](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/794) (@ozdanborne)
    - Fixed a bug where CNX would silently lose its connection to etcd and never recover when the etcd server was terminated. [libcalico-go #780](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/780) (@caseydavenport)
    - Fixed a bug when multiple nodes are restarted simultaneously and swap IP addresses [calico #1681](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/1681) (@caseydavenport)
    - Fixed a route scan issue where upon startup bird did not notice that tunneled routes needed to be updated to be non-tunneled. [calico #1679](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/1679) (@caseydavenport)
    - Enable Kubernetes node references for automatic cleanup of Node resources in etcd. [calico #1678](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/1678) (@caseydavenport)
    - Fixed a panic when BGP is disabled. [calico #1674](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/1674) (@tmjd)
    - Kubernetes self-hosted manifests now enable BGP IP address auto-detection by default. [calico #1588](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/1588) (@caseydavenport)

  note: |
    15 January 2018

    > **Important**: This release includes breaking changes to the data and
    > resource model. You can only upgrade Calico v3.0.1 clusters to CNX.
    > Upgrades from Tigera Essentials Toolkit to CNX are not currently supported.
    > We expect to add support for Tigera Essentials Toolkit upgrades in a future
    > release of CNX.
    {: .alert .alert-danger}

    #### What's new

    ##### Tiered policy

    Policies can be grouped into tiers to allow structured security policy.

    ##### CNX Manager

    A new web interface allows you to edit and manage tiers and policies.

    ##### CNX API server

    A RESTful API to edit and manage tiers and policies that can impose
    fine-grained control over what tiers users can manipulate policies in.

    ##### Prometheus updates

    The manifests now use Prometheus Operator v0.15.0 and are pinned to
    [Prometheus 2.0](https://prometheus.io/blog/2017/11/08/announcing-prometheus-2-0/).

    #### Calico features

    CNX 2.0 is built on Calico 3.0.  The changelog for Calico 3.0 follows.

    ##### Support for etcdv3

    CNX now stores its data in [etcd version 3](https://coreos.com/blog/etcd3-a-new-etcd.html).

    ##### calicoctl enhancements

    - Those using the Kubernetes API datastore can now use `calicoctl` to
      create, read, update, and delete CNX policies and tiers.

    - `calicoctl` features two new resources: [BGP Configuration](../reference/calicoctl/resources/bgpconfig)
      and [Felix Configuration](../reference/calicoctl/resources/felixconfig).

    - The `calicoctl` policy resource has been split into new [network policy](../reference/calicoctl/resources/networkpolicy)
      and [global network policy](../reference/calicoctl/resources/globalnetworkpolicy) resources.

    - [Network policy](../reference/calicoctl/resources/networkpolicy)
      resources can include a `namespace` value, allowing you to create policies that
      only apply to [workload endpoint resources](../reference/calicoctl/resources/workloadendpoint)
      in the same namespace.

    - You can now specify `namespaceSelector` expressions in
      [network policy](../reference/calicoctl/resources/networkpolicy)
      and [global network policy](../reference/calicoctl/resources/globalnetworkpolicy) rules to select one or more namespaces in their entirety.

    - The `get`, `apply`, `create`, `delete`, and `replace` commands of `calicoctl`
      now include an optional `--namespace=<NS>` flag. Refer to the `calicoctl`
      [Command reference](../reference/calicoctl/commands/) section for more details.

    - The `get` command of `calicoctl` now includes optional `--all-namespaces`
      and `--export` flags. Refer to the [calicoctl get](../reference/calicoctl/commands/get)
      section for more information.

    - `calicoctl` no longer accepts the following flags in `get` commands:
      `--node=<NODE>`, `--orchestrator=<ORCH>`, `--workload=<WORKLOAD>`, and
      `--scope=<SCOPE>`. These options are now a part of the individual resources.

    - `calicoctl` no longer includes a `config` command. To achieve the equivalent
      functionality, refer to [Modifying low-level component configurations](../reference/calicoctl/commands/#modifying-low-level-component-configurations).

    - You can now name [host](../reference/calicoctl/resources/hostendpoint#endpointport)
      and [workload](../reference/calicoctl/resources/workloadendpoint#endpointport)
      endpoint ports and reference them by name in your [policy rules](../reference/calicoctl/resources/networkpolicy#ports).

    - `calicoctl` now allows a `0` value for ICMP entries in policy resources,
      enabling `ping` responses. In addition, it now rejects `255` values in the
      `type` field due to lack of kernel support. Refer to the reference documentation
      of the [network policy](../reference/calicoctl/resources/networkpolicy#icmp)
      and [global network policy](../reference/calicoctl/resources/globalnetworkpolicy#icmp)
      resources for more information.

    - `calicoctl` now offers a new `convert` command, allowing 2.6.x manifests stored under
      version control to be converted to the v3.x format. [calicoctl #1782](https://github.com/projectcalico/calicoctl/pull/1782) (@gunjan5)

    ##### Host endpoint policies can be applied to forwarded traffic

    - The new `ApplyOnForward` flag allows you to specify if a host endpoint policy should
      apply to forwarded traffic or not. Forwarded traffic includes traffic forwarded between
      host endpoints and traffic forwarded between a host endpoint and a workload endpoint on
      the same host. Refer to [Using CNX to secure host interfaces](../getting-started/bare-metal/bare-metal)
      for more details.

    ##### CNI plugin changes

    - CNX now assigns the host side of veth pairs a MAC address of `ee:ee:ee:ee:ee:ee`.
      If this fails, it uses a kernel-generated MAC address as before. For more information,
      refer to the [Troubleshooting FAQ](../usage/troubleshooting/). [cni-plugin #436](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/436) (@tmjd)

    - The CNI plugin now offers an optional environment variable called `CNI_OLD_CONF_NAME`.
      If set, the CNI plug-in cleans up old configuration data during an upgrade, making it
      easier to migrate to a new `CNI_CONF_NAME` value. [cni-plugin #392](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/392)(@weikinhuang)

    - The CNI plugin no longer throws a `file exists` message when programming routes.
      [cni-plugin #406](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/406) (@gunjan5)

    - After a period of deprecation, this release removes support for the `ETCD_AUTHORITY`
      and `ETCD_SCHEME` environment variables. CNX no longer reads these values. If you have
      not transitioned to `ETCD_ENDPOINTS`, you must do so as of CNX v2.0. Refer to
      [Configuring calicoctl to connect to an etcdv3 datastore](../reference/calicoctl/setup/etcdv3) for more information.

    - A new node controller for Kubernetes deployments clears data associated with deleted
      nodes from the CNX datastore, preventing conflicts that can lead to crash loops. Refer
      to [Configuring the Calico Kubernetes controllers](../reference/kube-controllers/configuration) for more information.

    ##### Other changes

    - CNX now works with Kubernetes network services proxy with IPVS/LVS. CNX enforces
      network policies with kube-proxy running in IPVS mode for Kubernetes clusters. Currently
      only workload ingress policy is supported.

    - Rolling update is now enabled by default in the Kubernetes self-hosted manifests.
      [calico #1506](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/1506) (@caseydavenport)

    - Typha no longer sends incorrect `updateTypes` to Felix, increasing the accuracy of
      Felix statistics. [typha #70](https://github.com/projectcalico/typha/pull/70) (@fasaxc)

    - The CNI plugin now offers an optional environment variable called `CNI_OLD_CONF_NAME`.
      If set, the CNI plug-in cleans up old configuration data during an upgrade, making it
      easier to migrate to a new `CNI_CONF_NAME` value. [cni-plugin #392](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/pull/392)(@weikinhuang)

    #### Limitations

    - **GoBGP not supported**: Setting the `CALICO_NETWORKING_BACKEND` environment
      variable to `gobgp` is not supported. See [Configuring cnx-node](../reference/node/configuration)
      for more information. We plan to resume support for GoBPG in a future release.

    - **Route reflectors cannot be clustered**: We plan to resume support for
      this in a future release.

- title: v2.0.0-cnx-beta2
  note: |
    03 December 2017

    This is a pre-release of v2.0.0. This release is intended for testing purposes only and is NOT to be used on production systems.

    #### What's new

    - **Tiered policy**: policies can be grouped into tiers to allow structured security policy.

    - **CNX Manager**: a new web interface allows you to edit and manage tiers and policies.

    - **CNX API server**: a RESTful API to edit and manage tiers and policies that can impose fine-grained control over what tiers users can manipulate policies in.

    - **Prometheus operator update**: this release includes a newer Prometheus operator.

    - **Built on Calico v3.0.0-beta1**: including features and limitations of that release other than as specified here.

    #### Limitations

    - **No upgrades**: existing customers should start a fresh cluster for testing this release.  There is no migration support, and it is not possible to upgrade to or from this release.  We plan to add migration and upgrade support in the GA release from and to other GA releases, but never this beta.

    - **Integrates only with Kubernetes and host endpoints**: the OpenShift, OpenStack, Mesos, DC/OS, rkt, and Docker orchestrators have not been tested and are not supported. (CNX still supports Docker and rkt containers.) We plan to resume support for the OpenShift, OpenStack, Mesos, DC/OS, and Docker orchestrators in a future release.

    - **BGP route reflector not supported**: large deployments that require the [BGP route reflector](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.0/usage/routereflector/bird-rr-config) are not supported. We plan to resume support for the BGP route reflector in a future release.

    - **GoBGP not supported**: setting the `CALICO_NETWORKING_BACKEND` environment variable to `gobgp` is not supported. See [Configuring calico/node](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.0/reference/node/configuration) for more information. We plan to resume support for GoBPG in a future release.

    - **Typha not supported**: the Typha datastore proxy is not supported in this release.
