We provide a number of manifests to get you up and running with {{site.prodname}} in
just a few steps. Refer to the section that corresponds to your desired networking
for instructions.

- [Installing {{site.prodname}} for policy and networking (recommended)](calico)

- [Installing {{site.prodname}} for policy (advanced)](other)

Should you wish to modify the manifests before applying them, refer to
[Customizing the manifests](config-options).

If you prefer not to use Kubernetes to start the {{site.prodname}} services, refer to the
[Integration guide](integration).
