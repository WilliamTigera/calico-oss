# Platform support tagging is currently supported only in Calico Enterprise docs. 

# If you want a platform tag to appear for a topic, a "feature_name:" tag must be added to the topic header.
# If you specify "all" for a platform, all supported platforms in the "support_matrix_list" are displayed.
# Topics that should *not* have platform tags include: tech previews, topics in /Reference, MKE, and landing pages (index.md).
# Currently, unsupported features in Windows and eBPF should not included in the support matrix. Handle Windows and eBPF 
# unsupported features in their respective "Limitations and known issues" docs, or inline under "Before you begin"

# Support matrix for features.
# #
# 1. Add a page variable "feature_name" (should be a valid YAML key).
# 2. Add the same feature_name as a key under "matrix".
# 3. Define supported platforms as a list under the "platforms" key.
#
# Note that platforms can only be values already specified in the "support_matrix_list"
# in _config.yml

# Generic supports all
