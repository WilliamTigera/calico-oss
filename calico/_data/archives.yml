# this yaml file is used during building of the archive site.
# It is the source of truth for two different consumers:
# - the 'archive index' page which must show a link to each release
# - the netlify build machinery which must build each site.
# Each version has the following fields:
# - version: The version in vx.y format corresponding to a 'release-vX.Y' branch.
# - preview: if true, the version drop down shows a special badge.
# - latest: if true, it will be listed differently in the drop down and releases page
# Order matters - place latest releases first
