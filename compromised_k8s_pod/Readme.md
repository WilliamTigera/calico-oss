# Scenario: Compromised K8s Pod
This scenario covers the situation where the attacker is able to compromise a Pod within a K8s cluster. This pod can be a worker pod, privileged pod, or infrastructure pod in any Node. We assume thereâ€™s no network policy applied.

**The attacker is able to:**
* Reach all exposed services with Cluster IP, NodePort, etc within scope
* Reach externally and resources within VPC subnet (10.128.0.0/24) and K8s Nodes (10.128.0.0/24)
* Able to query the Kube DNS service for available services
* Get Token, Metadata, Credentials
* Access all data stored in container
* Access Host Mounted or connected resources
* [Privileged] Access underlying filesystem (Node)

**Honeypod:**
* IP Enumuration
* Exposed Service (Simulated)
* Vulnerable Service

**Other Mitigations:**
* Proper Namespacing, RBAC
* Network Policy for VPC subnet and external
* Non-root and not use privileged pod access unless absolutely needed
* Barebone OS Container Image
