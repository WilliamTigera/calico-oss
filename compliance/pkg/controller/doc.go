// Package controller contains the controller for Tigera compliance. It is based (almost entirely) off the
// v1.14.1 Kubernetes CronJob controller, but modified with the following tweaks:
//   - Reads Calico GlobalReport resources instead of K8s CronJob resources.
//   - Automatically deletes successful jobs
//   - Passes the correct job start and finish time to the report job
//   - Updates the GlobalReport status instead of the CronJob status
//   - Triggers the jobs at reportRetriever configured interval after the start of the next job (since data is historical and we need
//     to allow the data to be fully sent to the archive.
