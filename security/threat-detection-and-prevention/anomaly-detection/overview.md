{{site.prodname}} includes software that analyzes the logs of network communications
in your cluster [flow logs] to find anomalies that may indicate that your network or cluster is compromised.  As it depends on flow logs, it is supported on Kubernets or OpenShift clusters.

Anomaly detection jobs run in the Elasticsearch cluster that contains the flow
logs. You can configure the jobs to continuously analyze your logs as they are
added to the Elasticsearch cluster, or you can manually control the exact time
range you wish to analyze.

[flow logs]: ../../logs/elastic/datatypes
