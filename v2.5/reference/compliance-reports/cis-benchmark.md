title: CIS benchmark report
---

To create a CIS benchmark report, create a `GlobalReport` with the `reportType` set to `cis-benchmark`.

The following sample command uses a GlobalReport to create a daily CIS benchmark report that run on all the nodes.

```
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalReport
metadata: 
  name: daily-cis-benchmark-report
spec:
  reportType: cis-benchmark
  schedule: 0 0 * * *
```

## Openshift
While there is no extra setup configuration required by the user to generate a benchmark report for Openshift, the result sets will be different than a report generated for regular Kubernetes clusters. Use the [Openshift Container Platform security guide](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/security/securing_container_platform.html) to cross-reference the benchmark results.

## Security Note
Executing the CIS benchmarks requires running a pod with some elevated privileges. This includes access to the hostâ€™s process space, and volume mounting certain directories (/var/lib, /etc/systemd, /etc/kubernetes, /usr/bin) as read-only. If this is not considered an acceptable risk to your security organization, you can disable this feature by running the following command:

```
kubectl delete daemonset -n calico-monitoring compliance-benchmarker
```
