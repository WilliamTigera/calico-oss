## Metrics server

When the environment variable METRICS_ENABLED is set to true, a metrics server will listen at 0.0.0.0:
METRICS_PORT/metrics exposing two metrics:

- tigera_elastic_log_bytes_written
- tigera_elastic_log_bytes_read

The values should be closely related to actual data sent to and from Elasticsearch broken down per tenant and/or cluster
id. The tenant and cluster id are derived from the identity of the sender of the request and not on the payload or URL.
