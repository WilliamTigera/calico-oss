####Testing

#####Interface mocking

Most mocks are [testify mocks](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/#mock-package) generated using [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery). 
The mocks generated using mockery can be found in the environment variable MOCKERY_FILE_PATHS, and can be regenerated by running
``make gen-mocks``.
