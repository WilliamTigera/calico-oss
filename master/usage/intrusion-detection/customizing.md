{{site.prodname}} ships with Tigera-designed intrusion detection jobs, but you may customize the jobs
or design new ones to fit your environment using the full power of Elasticsearch machine learning.

Tigera **highly** recommends that you customize copies of the Tigera-designed jobs with different Job IDs,
rather than modify them in place.  Modification in place may result in loss of those customizations if
you reinstall or upgrade {{site.prodname}}.  To make a copy of a job:

1. Access Kibana by clicking the "Flows" icon along the left side of {{site.prodname}} Manager, or by visting
   the Kibana URL provided by your Elasticsearch admin.
1. If necessary, log into Kibana. Note that your Kibana credentials may not be the same as you use to access
   {{site.prodname}}; if you don't know your Kibana credentials, contact your Elasticsearch admin.
1. Click "Machine Learning" in the left-hand menu.
1. Click the gear icon to the far right of the job you wish to copy and select "Clone job"

Refer to the [Elasticsearch machine learning documentation] for more information on the configuration
options for machine learning jobs.
