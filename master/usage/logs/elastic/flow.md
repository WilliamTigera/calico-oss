{{site.prodname}} pushes the following data up to Elasticsearch. The following table
details the key/value pairs in the JSON blob, including their
[Elasticsearch datatype](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-types.html).
This information should assist you in constructing queries.
