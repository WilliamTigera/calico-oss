title: Kubernetes API datastore
---

This document describes how to install {{site.prodname}} on Kubernetes without a separate etcd cluster.
In this mode, {{site.prodname}} uses the Kubernetes API directly as the datastore.

Note that this mode currently comes with a number of limitations, namely:

- It does not yet support Calico IPAM.  It is recommended to use `host-local` IPAM in conjunction with Kubernetes pod CIDR assignments.
- {{site.prodname}} networking support is in beta. Control of the node-to-node mesh, default AS Number and all BGP peering configuration should be configured using `calicoctl`.

## Requirements

The provided manifest configures {{site.prodname}} to use host-local IPAM in conjunction with the Kubernetes assigned
pod CIDRs for each node.

You must have a Kubernetes cluster, which meets the following requirements:

- You are running Kubernetes `v1.7.0` or higher.
- You have a Kubernetes cluster configured to use CNI network plugins (i.e. by passing `--network-plugin=cni` to the kubelet)
- Your Kubernetes controller manager is configured to allocate pod CIDRs (i.e. by passing `--allocate-node-cidrs=true` to the controller manager)
- Your Kubernetes controller manager has been provided a cluster-cidr (i.e. by passing `--cluster-cidr=192.168.0.0/16`, which the manifest expects by default).
- Your Kubernetes API server is configured to [support the aggregation layer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/configure-aggregation-layer/).
- Your Kubernetes API server is configured to use a supported authentication method

## Installation

This document describes three installation options for {{site.prodname}} using Kubernetes API as the datastore:

1. {{site.prodname}} policy with {{site.prodname}} networking (beta)
2. {{site.prodname}} policy-only with user-supplied networking

Ensure you have a cluster which meets the above requirements.  There may be additional requirements based on the installation option you choose.

> **Note**: There is currently no upgrade path to switch between
> different installation options. Therefore, if you are upgrading
> from Calico v2.1, use the
> [Calico policy-only with user-supplied networking](#policy-only)
> installation instructions to upgrade Calico policy-only which
> leaves the networking solution unchanged.

### Before you start: if your cluster has RBAC enabled

Install {{site.prodname}}'s RBAC manifest, which creates roles and role bindings for {{site.prodname}}'s components:

```
kubectl apply -f rbac-kdd.yaml
```
   > **Note**: You can also
   > [view the YAML in your browser](../rbac-kdd.yaml){:target="_blank"}.
   {: .alert .alert-info}


### Option 1. {{site.prodname}} policy with {{site.prodname}} networking (Beta)

With Kubernetes as the {{site.prodname}} datastore, {{site.prodname}} has beta support for {{site.prodname}} networking.  This provides BGP-based
networking with a full node-to-node mesh and/or explicit configuration of peers.

To install {{site.prodname}} with {{site.prodname}} networking, run one of the commands below based on your Kubernetes version.
This will install {{site.prodname}} and will initially create a full node-to-node mesh.

1. Download [the {{site.prodname}} networking manifest](calico-networking/1.7/calico.yaml){:target="_blank"}

1. Use the following `sed` command to update the manifest to point to the private
   Docker registry. Before issuing this command, replace `<REPLACE_ME>` 
   with the name of your private Docker registry.

   **Command**
   ```shell
   sed -i -e 's/<YOUR_PRIVATE_DOCKER_REGISTRY>/<REPLACE_ME>/g' calico.yaml
   ```
   
   **Example**

   ```shell
   sed -i -e 's/<YOUR_PRIVATE_DOCKER_REGISTRY>/bob/g' calico.yaml
   ```
   > **Tip**: If you're hosting your own private repository, you may need to include
   > a port number. For example, `bob:5000`.
   {: .alert .alert-success}

2. If your Kubernetes cluster contains more than 50 nodes, or it is likely to grow to
   more than 50 nodes, edit the manifest to [enable Typha](#enabling-typha).

3. Make sure your cluster CIDR matches the `CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR` environment variable in the manifest.
   The cluster CIDR is configured by the  `--cluster-cidr` option passed to the Kubernetes
   controller manager.  If you are using `kubeadm` that option is controlled by `kubeadm`'s
   `--pod-network-cidr` option.

   > **Note**: {{site.prodname}} only uses the `CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR` variable if there is no
   > IP pool already created.  Changing the variable after the first node has started has no
   > effect.
   {: .alert .alert-info}

4. Apply the manifest: `kubectl apply -f calico.yaml`

5. If your Kubernetes cluster has more than 100 nodes, we recommend disabling the
   node-to-node BGP mesh and configuring a pair of redundant route reflectors.
   Due to limitations in the Kubernetes API, maintaining the node-to-node mesh
   uses significant CPU (in the `confd` process on each host and the API server)
   as the number of nodes increases.

   Alternatively, if you're running on-premise, you may want to configure Calico
   to peer with your BGP infrastructure.

   In either case, see the [Configuring BGP Peers guide]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/usage/configuration/bgp)
   for details on using `calicoctl` to configure your topology.

### <a name="policy-only"></a> Option 2: {{site.prodname}} policy-only with user-supplied networking

If you run {{site.prodname}} in policy-only mode it is necessary to configure your network to route pod traffic based on pod
CIDR allocations, either through static routes, a Kubernetes cloud-provider integration, or flannel (self-installed).

To install {{site.prodname}} in policy-only mode:

1. Download [the policy-only manifest](policy-only/1.7/calico.yaml)

1. Use the following `sed` command to update the manifest to point to the private
   Docker registry. Before issuing this command, replace `<REPLACE_ME>` 
   with the name of your private Docker registry.

   **Command**
   ```shell
   sed -i -e 's/<YOUR_PRIVATE_DOCKER_REGISTRY>/<REPLACE_ME>/g' calico.yaml
   ```
   
   **Example**

   ```shell
   sed -i -e 's/<YOUR_PRIVATE_DOCKER_REGISTRY>/bob/g' calico.yaml
   ```
   > **Tip**: If you're hosting your own private repository, you may need to include
   > a port number. For example, `bob:5000`.
   {: .alert .alert-success}

1. Then apply the manifest.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f calico.yaml
   ```

## Installing the CNX Manager

1. [Open cnx-kdd.yaml in a new tab](../cnx/1.7/cnx-kdd.yaml){:target="_blank"}.

1. Copy the contents, paste them into a new file, and save the file as cnx.yaml.
   This is what subsequent instructions will refer to.

{% include {{page.version}}/gs-next-steps.md %}

## Configuration details

The following environment variable configuration options are supported by the various {{site.prodname}}
components when using the Kubernetes API datastore.

| Option           | Description    | Examples
|------------------|----------------|----------
| DATASTORE_TYPE   | Indicates the datastore to use | kubernetes
| KUBECONFIG       | When using the Kubernetes API datastore, the location of a kubeconfig file to use. | /path/to/kube/config
| K8S_API_ENDPOINT | Location of the Kubernetes API.  Not required if using kubeconfig. | https://kubernetes-api:443
| K8S_CERT_FILE    | Location of a client certificate for accessing the Kubernetes API. | /path/to/cert
| K8S_KEY_FILE     | Location of a client key for accessing the Kubernetes API. | /path/to/key
| K8S_CA_FILE      | Location of a CA for accessing the Kubernetes API. | /path/to/ca
| K8S_TOKEN        | Token to be used for accessing the Kubernetes API. |

An example using `calicoctl`:

```shell
$ export DATASTORE_TYPE=kubernetes
$ export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
$ calicoctl get workloadendpoints

HOSTNAME                      ORCHESTRATOR  WORKLOAD                                       NAME
kubernetes-minion-group-tbmi  k8s           kube-system.kube-dns-v20-jhk10                 eth0
kubernetes-minion-group-x7ce  k8s           kube-system.kubernetes-dashboard-v1.4.0-wtrtm  eth0
```

## How it works

{{site.prodname}} typically uses `etcd` to store information about Kubernetes pods, namespaces, and network policies.  This information
is populated to etcd by the CNI plugin and the Kubernetes controllers, and is interpreted by Felix and BIRD to program the dataplane on
each host in the cluster.

The above manifest deploys {{site.prodname}} such that Felix uses the Kubernetes API directly to learn the required information to enforce policy,
removing {{site.prodname}}'s dependency on etcd and the need for the Kubernetes controllers.

The CNI plugin is still required to configure each pod's virtual ethernet device and network namespace.
