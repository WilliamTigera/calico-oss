title: Installing CNX for policy and networking (recommended)
---

## Before you begin

- Ensure that you have a Kubernetes cluster that meets the {{site.prodname}}
  [system requirements](../requirements). If you don't, follow the steps in
  [Using kubeadm to create a cluster](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/).

- If you are planning to federate multiple clusters using the Federated Endpoint Identity feature, please read the
  [Federated Identity Overview](../../../usage/federation/index) to understand additional installation requirements
  for each of your clusters.

- Ensure that you have the [private registry credentials](../../../getting-started/#obtain-the-private-registry-credentials)
  and a [license key](../../../getting-started/#obtain-a-license-key).

## <a name="install-cnx"></a>Installing {{site.prodname}} for policy and networking

### Selecting your datastore type and number of nodes

The procedure differs according to the type of datastore you want {{site.prodname}}
to use, the number of nodes and whether you will be using [federated endpoint identity](../../../usage/federation/index). Refer to the
section that matches your use case.

- [etcd datastore without federation](#installing-for-etcd-datastore-without-federation)

- [etcd datastore with federation](#installing-for-etcd-datastore-with-federation)

- [Kubernetes API datastore, 50 nodes or less and without federation](#50-nodes-or-less)

- [Kubernetes API datastore, more than 50 nodes and/or with federation](#installing-for-kubernetes-api-datastore-more-than-50-nodes-or-with-federation)

> **Note**: {{site.prodname}} networking with the Kubernetes API datastore
> is beta because it does not yet support {{site.prodname}} IPAM. It uses
> `host-local` IPAM with Kubernetes pod CIDR assignments instead.
{: .alert .alert-info}

### Installing for etcd datastore: without federation

1. If your cluster has RBAC enabled, issue the following command to
   configure the roles and bindings that {{site.prodname}} requires.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f \
   {{site.url}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/rbac.yaml
   ```
   > **Note**: You can also
   > [view the manifest in your browser](rbac.yaml){:target="_blank"}.
   {: .alert .alert-info}

1. Download the {{site.prodname}} networking manifest for etcd.

   ```bash
   curl \
   {{site.url}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/calico.yaml \
   -O
   ```

1. In the `ConfigMap` named `calico-config`, set the value of
   `etcd_endpoints` to the IP address and port of your etcd server.

   > **Tip**: You can specify more than one using commas as delimiters.
   {: .alert .alert-success}

{% include {{page.version}}/cnx-pod-cidr-sed.md yaml="calico" %}

{% include {{page.version}}/cnx-cred-sed.md yaml="calico" %}

1. Apply the manifest using the following command.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f calico.yaml
   ```

1. Continue to [Applying your license key](#applying-your-license-key).

### Installing for etcd datastore: with federation

1. If your cluster has RBAC enabled, issue the following command to
   configure the roles and bindings that {{site.prodname}} requires.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f \
   {{site.url}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/rbac-etcd-typha.yaml
   ```
   > **Note**: You can also
   > [view the manifest in your browser](rbac-etcd-typha.yaml){:target="_blank"}.
   {: .alert .alert-info}

1. Download the {{site.prodname}} networking manifest for etcd.

   ```bash
   curl \
   {{site.url}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/etcd-typha/calico.yaml \
   -O
   ```

1. In the `ConfigMap` named `calico-config`, set the value of
   `etcd_endpoints` to the IP address and port of your etcd server.

   > **Tip**: You can specify more than one using commas as delimiters.
   {: .alert .alert-success}

1. In the `ConfigMap` named `calico-config`, locate the `typha_service_name`,
   delete the `none` value, and replace it with `calico-typha`.

1. Modify the replica count in the`Deployment` named `calico-typha`
   to the desired number of replicas.

   ```
   apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: calico-typha
     ...
   spec:
     ...
     replicas: <number of replicas>
   ```

   We recommend at least one replica for every 200 nodes and no more than
   20 replicas. In production, we recommend a minimum of three replicas to reduce
   the impact of rolling upgrades and failures.

   > **Warning**: If you set `typha_service_name` without increasing the replica
   > count from its default of `0` Felix will try to connect to Typha, find no
   > Typha instances to connect to, and fail to start.

1. If you have created some secrets for Federation, then modify the manifest to mount the secrets into the
   container.  For details see [Configuring a Remote Cluster for Federation](/{{page.version}}/usage/federation/configure-rcc).

   > **Warning**: If you are upgrading from a previous release and previously had secrets mounted in for
   > federation, then failure to include these secrets in this manifest will result in loss of federation
   > functionality, which may include loss of service between clusters.
   {: .alert .alert-danger}

1. Apply the manifest using the following command.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f calico.yaml
   ```

1. Continue to [Applying your license key](#applying-your-license-key).

1. If you wish to enforce application layer policies and secure workload-to-workload
   communications with mutual TLS authentication, continue to [Enabling application layer policy](app-layer-policy) (optional).

### <a name="50-nodes-or-less"></a> Installing with the Kubernetes API datastoreâ€”50 nodes or less

1. Ensure that the Kubernetes controller manager has the following flags
   set: <br>
   `--cluster-cidr=192.168.0.0/16` and `--allocate-node-cidrs=true`.

   > **Tip**: On kubeadm, you can pass `--pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16`
   > to kubeadm to set both Kubernetes controller flags.
