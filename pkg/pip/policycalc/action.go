	// These action flags provide additional information about how the action was determined and, therefore, how
	// trustworthy the calculated result is
	// -  Whether the calculated policy hit is exact (i.e. there is no uncertainty in the calculation) *and* exactly
	//    matches the policy hit in the flow log.
	// -  Whether calculated policy hit is uncertain (due to insufficient data), but the flow log policy hit matches one
	//    of the possible calculated hits and can therefore be used to select the same calculated value.
	// -  Whether a calculated action did not agree with the policy hit in the flow log. For example, the policy
	//    calculation may determine an allow hit on policy X in tier A, but the flow log data actually has a deny hit or
	//    does not match that policy at all.
	//
	// Note that is a policy is adjusted as part of the preview action then flow log data that directly or indirectly
	// involves that policy cannot be used to augment the calculation.  For example:
	// -  Policy A in tier X is adjusted. Flow log shows policy B in tier X is "hit".  Policy B is ordered after A.
	//    We can infer that policy A is a no-match in the original flow.
	//    -  If calculation for policy A is uncertain then we can use the indirectly determined "no-match" iff the
	//       policy was not modified.
	// This applies to staged policies as well - these can provide some clarity for no-matches.
