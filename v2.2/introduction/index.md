Modern applications are more distributed, dynamically orchestrated, and
run across multi-cloud infrastructure. To protect workloads and enforce
compliance, connectivity must be established and secured in a highly dynamic
environment that includes microservices, containers, and virtual machines.

{{site.tseeprodname}} provides secure application connectivity across multi-cloud and
legacy environments, with the enterprise control and compliance capabilities
required for mission-critical deployments.

Designed from the ground up as cloud-native software, {{site.tseeprodname}} builds on leading
open source projects like [Calico](https://docs.projectcalico.org/).
It connects and secures container, virtual machine, and bare metal host
workloads in public cloud and private data centers.
