The following {{site.prodname}} components must accept connections on
a configurable port. By default, these components can be scheduled to any agent node.
Therefore, any given node may have the required ports open. To reduce the number of
nodes with the ports open to a subset of the total, consider
[scheduling these components to well-known nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/).
