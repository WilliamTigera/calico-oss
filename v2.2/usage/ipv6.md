### About enabling IPv6

After enabling IPv6:
- Workloads can communicate over IPv6.
- Workloads can initiate connections to IPv6 services.
- Workloads can terminate incoming IPv6 connections.

## Enabling IPv6 with Kubernetes

### Limitations

- Currently Kubernetes supports only one IP stack version at a time. This
  means that if you configure Kubernetes for IPv6 then {{site.prodname}}
  should be configured to assign only IPv6 addresses.
- The steps and setup here have not been tested against an existing IPv4
  cluster and are intended only for new clusters.

### Prerequisites

#### Host prerequisites

- Each Kubernetes host must have an IPv6 address that is reachable from
  the other hosts.
- Each host must have the sysctl setting `net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding`
  setting it to `1`.  This ensures both Kubernetes service traffic
  and {{site.prodname}} traffic is forwarded appropriately.
- Each host must have a default IPv6 route.

#### Kubernetes components prerequisites

Kubernetes components must be configured to operate with IPv6.
To enable IPv6, set the following flags.

##### kube-apiserver

| Flag | Value/Content |
| ---- | ------------- |
| `--bind-address` or `--insecure-bind-address` | Should be set to the appropriate IPv6 address or `::` for all IPv6 addresses on the host. |
| `--advertise-address` | Should be set to the IPv6 address that nodes should use to access the kube-apiserver. |
| `--service-cluster-ip-range` | Should be set to an IPv6 CIDR that will be used for the Service IPs, the DNS service address must be in this range. |

##### kube-controller-manager

| Flag | Value/Content |
| ---- | ------------- |
| `--master` | Should be set with the IPv6 address where the kube-apiserver can be accessed. |
| `--node-cidr-mask-size` | If the `--allocate-node-cidrs` flag is set then it is necessary to set this flag, they are necessary when using host-local IPAM. If using calico-ipam is is easier to remove both flags as they are not needed. |
| `--cluster-cidr` | Should be set to match the {{site.prodname}} IPv6 IPPool. |

##### kube-scheduler

| Flag | Value/Content |
| ---- | ------------- |
| `--master` | Should be set with the IPv6 address where the kube-apiserver can be accessed. |

##### kubelet

| Flag | Value/Content |
| ---- | ------------- |
| `--address` | Should be set to the appropriate IPv6 address or `::` for all IPv6 addresses. |
| `--cluster-dns` | Should be set to the IPv6 address that will be used for the service DNS, this must be in the range used for `--service-cluster-ip-range`. |
| `--node-ip` | Should be set to the IPv6 address of the node. |

##### kube-proxy

| Flag | Value/Content |
| ---- | ------------- |
| `--bind-address` | Should be set to the appropriate IPv6 address or `::` for all IPv6 addresses on the host. |
| `--master` | Should be set with the IPv6 address where the kube-apiserver can be accessed. |
| `--cluster-cidr` | Should be set to match the {{site.prodname}} IPv6 IPPool. |

### Enabling IPv6 support in {{site.prodname}}

To enable IPv6 support when installing {{site.prodname}} follow the
steps below.

1. Download the {{site.prodname}} manifest you wish to update for IPv6
   deployment and save it as `calico.yaml`.
1. If the ipam section in the `cni_network_config` in the `calico.yaml` file
   has `"type": "calico-ipam"` then it should be modified to
   [disable IPv4 assignments and enable IPv6
   assigments](/{{page.version}}/reference/cni-plugin/configuration#ipam).
1. Add the following environment variables to the calico-node Daemonset in
   the `calico.yaml` file. Be sure to set the value for `CALICO_IPV6POOL_CIDR`
   to the desired pool, it should match the `--cluster-cidr` passed to the
   kube-controller-manager and to kube-proxy.

   ```
   - name: CALICO_IPV6POOL_CIDR
     value: "fd20::0/112"
   - name: IP6
     value: "autodetect"
   ```

1. Ensure in the `calico.yaml` file that the environment variable
   `FELIX_IPV6SUPPORT` is set `true` on the calico-node Daemonset.
1. Apply the `calico.yaml` manifest with `kubectl apply -f calico.yaml`.

#### Using only IPv6

If you wish to only use IPv6 (by disabling IPv4) or your hosts only have
IPv6 addresses, you must disable autodetection of IPv4 by setting `IP`
to `none`.  With that set you must also pass a `CALICO_ROUTER_ID` to each
calico-node pod.

### Modifying your DNS for IPv6

It will probably be necessary to modify your DNS pod for IPv6. If you are using
[kube-dns](/{{page.version}}/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/manifests/kubedns.yaml),
then the following changes will ensure IPv6 operation.

- Update the image versions to at least `1.14.8`.
- Ensure the clusterIP for the DNS service matches the one specified to
  the kubelet as `--cluster-dns`.
- Add `--dns-bind-address=[::]` to the arguments for the kubedns container.
- Add `--no-negcache` to the arguments for the dnsmasq container.
- Switch the arguments on the sidecar container from
  ```
  --probe=kubedns,127.0.0.1:10053,kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local,5,A
  --probe=dnsmasq,127.0.0.1:53,kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local,5,A
  ```
  to
  ```
  --probe=kubedns,127.0.0.1:10053,kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local,5,SRV
  --probe=dnsmasq,127.0.0.1:53,kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local,5,SRV
  ```
