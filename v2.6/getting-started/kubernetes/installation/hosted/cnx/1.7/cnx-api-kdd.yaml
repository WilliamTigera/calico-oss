# This manifest adds the additional Tigera Secure EE components to a cluster
# that has already had the Calico part of Tigera Secure EE deployed.
# - It refers to the calico-config ConfigMap from that file, so if you are
#   not using the provided hosted Calico manifest you must update
#   references to that resource in this file.
# - Optionally update the cnx-apiserver-certs ConfigMap and caBundle in the
#   apiregistration section below to use your TLS certs for secure communication
#   between the Tigera Secure EE API server and Kubernetes API server.
