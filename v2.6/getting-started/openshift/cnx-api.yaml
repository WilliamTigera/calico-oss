# This manifest adds the additional Calico Enterprise components to a cluster
# that has already had the Calico part of Calico Enterprise deployed.
# - It refers to the calico-config ConfigMap and calico-etcd-secrets Secret
#   from that file, so if you are not using the provided hosted Calico
#   manifest you must update references to those resources in this file.
# - Optionally update the cnx-apiserver-certs ConfigMap and caBundle in the
#   apiregistration section below to use your TLS certs for secure communication
#   between the Calico Enterprise API server and Kubernetes API server.
