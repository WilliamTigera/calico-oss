title: Configure MTU to maximize network performance

### Big picture

Configure the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for your {{site.prodname}} environment.

### Value

Optimize network performance for workloads by configuring the MTU in {{site.prodname}} to best suit your underlying network.

Increasing the MTU can improve performance, and decreasing the MTU when it is too high can resolve packet loss and fragmentation problems.

### Concepts

#### MTU and {{site.prodname}} defaults

The maximum transmission unit (MTU) setting determines the largest packet size that can be transmitted through your network.
MTU is configured on the veth attached to each workload, and tunnel devices (if you enable IP in IP and/or VXLAN).
The workload MTU should not be larger than the tunnel devices' MTU.

In general, maximum performance is achieved by using the highest MTU value that does not cause fragmentation or drop packets on the path.
Maximum bandwidth increases, and CPU consumption for a given traffic rate may drop.
The improvement is often more significant when pod to pod traffic is being encapsulated (IP in IP or VXLAN), and splitting and combining such traffic cannot be offloaded to your NICs.

For example, if you are using AWS, you may be able to use jumbo frames up to 9000 bytes.
If you are using {{site.prodname}} overlay networks, you may need to adjust the MTU settings to ensure packets arenâ€™t dropped because of an MTU that is too large for the network.

### Before you begin...

#### Determine MTU size

The default MTU set by {{site.prodname}} is 1410, which may or may not be suitable for your environment.
The following table lists common MTU sizes for {{site.prodname}} environments.
Because MTU is a global property of the network path between endpoints, you should set the MTU to the minimum MTU of any path that packets may take.

**Common MTU sizes**

| Network MTU            | {{site.prodname}} MTU | {{site.prodname}} MTU with IP-in-IP (IPv4) | {{site.prodname}} MTU with VXLAN (IPv4) |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 1500                   | 1500                  | 1480                                       | 1450                                    |
| 9000                   | 9000                  | 8980                                       | 8950                                    |
| 1460 (GCE)             | 1460                  | 1440                                       | 1410                                    |
| 9001 (AWS Jumbo)       | 9001                  | 8981                                       | 8951                                    |
| 1450 (OpenStack VXLAN) | 1450                  | 1430                                       | 1400                                    |

##### Recommended MTU for overlay networking

The extra overlay header used in IP in IP and VXLAN protocols, reduces the minimum MTU by the size of the header. (IP in IP uses a 20-byte header, and VXLAN uses a 50-byte header).
Therefore, we recommend the following:

- If you use VXLAN anywhere in your pod network, configure MTU size as "physical network MTU size minus 50".
- If you use only IP in IP, configure MTU size as "physical network MTU size minus 20"
- Set the workload endpoint MTU and the tunnel MTUs to the same value (so all paths have the same MTU)

##### MTU for flannel networking

When using flannel for networking, the MTU for network interfaces should match the MTU of the flannel interface.
If using flannel with VXLAN, use the "Calico MTU with VXLAN" column in the table above for common sizes.

#### Configure MTU

Update the MTU by patching the Installation resource:

```
kubectl patch installation default --type merge -p \
  '{"spec": {"calicoNetwork": {"mtu": NEW_MTU}}}'
```

where `NEW_MTU` is an integer.

For more information on configuration options available in this manifest, see [the installation reference](/{{page.version}}/reference/installation/api).

> Note: When you set the MTU it applies to new workloads. To apply MTU changes to existing workloads, you must restart those workloads.

##### View existing tunnel MTU values

To view the existing tunnel size, use the command:

`ip link show`

The IP in IP tunnel appears as tunlx (for example, tunl0), along with the MTU size. For example:
