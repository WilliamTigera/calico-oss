## Prerequisites

Verify that your Kubernetes cluster is using a version of {{site.prodname}} installed with the operator, by running 
`kubectl get tigerastatus`. If the result is successful, then your installation is using the operator.

If your cluster is on a version earlier than 2.6 or does not use the operator, contact Tigera support to upgrade.

If your cluster has a Calico installation, contact Tigera support to upgrade.

## Prepare your cluster for the upgrade

During the upgrade the controller that manages Elasticsearch is updated. Because of this, the {{site.prodname}} LogStorage 
CR is temporarily removed during upgrade. Features that depend on LogStorage are temporarily unavailable, among which
are the dashboards in the Manager UI. Data ingestion is temporarily paused and will continue when the LogStorage is
up and running again.

To retain data from your current installation (optional), ensure that the currently mounted persistent volumes 
have their reclaim policy set to [retain data](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-pv-reclaim-policy/){:target="_blank"}.
Retaining data is only recommended for users that use a valid Elastic license. Trial licenses can get invalidated during 
the upgrade.

## Upgrade from 3.0 or later

**Note**: These steps differ based on your cluster type. If you are unsure of your cluster type, look at the field `clusterManagementType` when you run `kubectl get installation -o yaml` before you proceed.
