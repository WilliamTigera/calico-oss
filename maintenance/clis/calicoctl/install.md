## About installing calicoctl

`calicoctl` allows you to create, read, update, and delete {{site.prodname}} objects
from the command line. These objects represent the networking and policy
of your cluster.

You should limit access to `calicoctl` and your {{site.prodname}} datastore to
trusted administrators. We discuss methods of limiting access to the
{{site.prodname}} datastore in the [configuration section](configure).

You can run `calicoctl` on any host with network access to the
{{site.prodname}} datastore as either a binary or a container.
As a binary on a single host, you can also run it as a kubectl plugin.
For step-by-step instructions, refer to the section that
corresponds to your desired deployment.
